# Vercel MCP Capability

## Capability

Vercel project, deployment, log, and documentation access.

## Purpose

Useful for inspecting linked projects, deployment status, build or runtime logs, environment metadata, and platform documentation when repository-local configuration is insufficient.

## Requirement

Optional by default. Required only when Vercel-hosted state affects the task and cannot be inferred from the repository, local verification, or CI.

## Source Of Truth

Keep application code and `backend/vercel.json` in the repository. Treat Vercel as the source of truth for live deployment state and environment metadata. The repository does not establish an external secret manager; never infer authority to read or edit environment values.

## Git And CI/CD

No repository CI workflow is currently checked in. Treat creating, promoting, rolling back, or bypassing a deployment as a production-affecting action requiring explicit authorization.

## Expected Scope

Prefer access limited to the relevant account, team, and project. Read deployments and logs as needed. Creating, promoting, rolling back, or cancelling deployments, changing domains or project settings, editing environment variables, or affecting production requires explicit authorization.

## Local Tooling

Vercel's hosted remote MCP server does not require the `vercel` CLI. Adopt the CLI only when project commands use it for local environment retrieval, builds, logs, or deployment operations. Keep its installation and authentication outside the bootstrap installer.

## Configuration

Prefer Vercel's official OAuth-based MCP endpoint, `https://mcp.vercel.com`, when the agent host supports it. Verify its current maturity, available tools, and effective access before relying on it. Keep host-specific connection state outside the repository and record exact verified CLI commands in `.agents/COMMANDS.md` only when the project adopts them.

See the official [Vercel MCP documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/agent-resources/vercel-mcp).

## Security Notes

Connecting the MCP server grants access derived from the authenticated Vercel user. Use a narrowly scoped account where practical. Do not expose environment values, access tokens, private logs, customer data, or deployment secrets in repository files or agent output.
